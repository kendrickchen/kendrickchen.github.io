summary: Helped design a wholesale website for a small business with the help of Squarespace.
---
In my second job, I helped a design a wholesale website to serve as an extra tool in attracting clients for the small business that I am currently working with. This was done with the use of Squarespace, which is a website development tool that serves to host websites as well as give making the website development process much easier without needing to hardcode everything. However, this website is still a work in progress open to updates, which means I am hoping to implement my newfound HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge towards further customizing and improving the website. 
Through this process I learned the importance of communication with the actual owners of the website in order to accurately provide them with what they need. It also gave me an idea of what a desirable user interface would be and could identify what factors could make a website convenient or cluttery.
