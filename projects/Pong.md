summary: I made my own customized replica of Pong in ICS 111 with Eclipse as my IDE.
---
My first ever project was made in my first programming class, which was ICS 111, an intro class into computer science, at UH Manoa. The project had us replicate the iconic video game pong. This was the first time that I had spent a considerable amount of time on a coding assignment, but was one of the most influential as it taught me how to problem solve and do research on my own. 
The project description was given through step by step instructions of where we had to look within the code as well as how to go about solving the many parts needed for the game. We were also given the freedom of customizing the aesthetics of the project and I had ended up with a street fighter theme with my own music playing in the background.
