summary: Developed an address book using C++ during my time in ICS 212. 
---
This project made up my projects needed during my time in ICS 212. The goal of the project was to create an address book that stored a list of names with other fields pertaining to other personal information related to the name. This was to be done in SSH Shell, which would have been my first time developing on a command console rather than on an IDE. 
The project had taught me more ways on how to problem solve and also strengthened my understanding of pointers when creating dynamic lists to be updated. This project would be my biggest and most challenging assignment in computer science to date and incorporated a variety of subjects such as overloading, pointers, as well as learning C++.
