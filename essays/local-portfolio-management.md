Configuration management is essential when dealing with large projects manned by a large group of people. If everyone were to make changes to a program at once, the absence of a medium such as git would make situations very chaotic in a short amount of time due to the lack of organization and record keeping. However, there are such mediums available and git is a highly useful way to go about keeping projects organized and in control. In my case, I have not yet had the need to utilize configuration management as I have not yet had to deal with large projects with many people working on it at once. However, I do believe good practice and habits are essential when collaborating even with a configuration management system as things can still get chaotic and disorganized.

I believe git is popular because of GitHub because GitHub is the site where everything made in git is shared with the public, which is where collaboration is made possible. This makes git a very powerful and effective tool in development and demonstrates the importance of configuration management in software engineering. With git, you can keep track of repositories and any changes that you have made, even offline, which makes development and logging changes much easier. Ease of organization and accessibility are exceptional benefits to Git and, besides GitHub, attribute greatly to Git's popularity on their own.
