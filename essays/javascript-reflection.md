Prior languages that I have had experience in only include Java, C++, and C. Compared to those languages, I like javascript because it doesn't need to deal with classes unlike Java and C++. Javascript is also nice in that most of the memory management is "automated" unlike C. Javascript is also syntactically similar to some of these languages, which helps a lot with the learning process in the beginning. I think javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective, but every language has its pros and cons. Performance-wise, javascript may not be the best language to choose, but it is highly accessible to anyone as long as they can open up a browser. It is also one of the most used and popular programmings in the world due to its prevalence throughout the internet. If you want to make software that most people will get to use, you will most likely need to know javascript since web-based applications are continually growing in popularity. 

I do find the practice WODs to be useful and rather enjoyable because it gives me an opportunity to gauge where my level of aptitude is at. Even when I am unable to finish a WOD on my own within the time limit, I still learn a lot from comparing my code to the solution afterwards in order to pick up any careless mistakes or new strategies to problem solving. However, having taken my first in-class WOD today, the difference in pressure was significant as my grade was on the line and my success or failure in solving the problem would have a larger impact on it. 

The practice WODs did seem to help to an extent because it let me practice being in a time limited situation and gave me learning experiences, but I do feel I need more time to accomodate the skill to do them in class. In conclusion, at the moment I find the practice WODs enjoyable and see how they can help me improve for the future. In-class WODs are similar, but gives me a greater amount of stress and, at the moment, I am not sure if that will work for me but I will continue trying my best to adapt and improve on my WOD scores.
