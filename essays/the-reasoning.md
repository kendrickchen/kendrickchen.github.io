What got me interested in software engineering was knowing that if my skills became developed enough, I could potentially gain the ability to personalize my software with the use of my own creativy and technical skills. With this, I believe I will end up enjoying programming a lot more than I do now as the possibilities would be seemingly limitless depending on my skillset. 

I look forward to learning more about web development and hope to gain more skills and knowledge that could help me build an interactive website of my own. I hope to experience more of what it's like to work in groups to achieve an objective because up until now I haven't really gotten the chance to do that yet.

I also hope to find more ways of developing my professional persona in order to gain more credibility for the future. I also wish to develop my problem solving skills even further in order to tackle more advanced problems that I may run into. Studying software engineering should help me attain these goals as there will be more opportunities to practice, especially with the introduction of teammates.
