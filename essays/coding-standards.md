## What are coding standards?

Coding standards allow a program to be more readable and standardized in syntax and readability in order to make it uniform enough so that anyone else other than the one who worked on the program could read it and understand it. From this, an individual working with coding standards could definitely find that it helps with learning a language as it develops good habits and may even find that standards lead to a better understanding of one's own code. With better readability, one would significantly lower the chances of spending time fixing syntactic errors, which would lead to higher efficiency when developing a program. 

## ESLint Experience

From my initial experience with ESLint, I actually found that it is quite useful in keeping code organized and readable and makes sure that you keep track of proper syntax notations such as brackets or braces in order to help you visualize the scope of your program better. In the event that you make an error resulting from coding standards, you can easily fix the problem by hovering over the error which will provide you with the exact reason for the error and allows you to get rid of it in the least amount of time. At the same time, however, this allows you to learn and develop good habits which I find extremely useful as one day I may not have a coding standard such as ESLint, but would still like to keep your program organized and readable. In the end, I believe ESLint is painful at first because the more habits you have that conflict with coding standards, the more problems you will have to fix and sometimes habits die hard. Towards the end, ESLint has proved to be useful and less of a hassle over time. Though in a timed scenario I can see how ESLint would be very frustrating to have as you may want to spend less time, initially, on organization when your main goal is to solve a problem. 

## Conclusion

Personally, I find that getting the green checkmark feels rather good and leaves me feeling accomplished. In the end, the code looks organized and is easy to follow and leaves no chance for syntactical errors to show up and waste time. Though, of course, getting to the checkmark alone can be rather frustrating but the end result is rather satisfying. In the end, I believe getting the checkmark is something else entirely and is akin to a love and hate relationship.
