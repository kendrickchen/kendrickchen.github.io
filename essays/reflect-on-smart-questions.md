Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Smart questions are important for software engineers because the process of learning and development is evergrowing due to the sheer amount of problems that they will face over time. There will be difficult questions that will take up significant amounts of time and this can lead to inefficiencies in use of time when developing a program if the question deals with something of a rather small and isolated scope that even those that aren't working on your project can analyze and get a hold of the problem at hand. Luckily, there are online forums available that dedicate themselves to answering other peoples' questions in order to help them solve a problem. However, in order to receive effective answers and comments from the community, the individual that is asking the question must be concise and show intent that they are willing to learn rather than simply take answers.
The "bad" question that I have listed shows a lack of the precepts needed in order to be labeled a "smart" question, according to Eric Raymond - author of "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way". The question is difficult to answer because the user starts off the post listing a bunch of problems they had run into without proper explanation or details. The poster then proceeds to ask a number of vague questions some of which can be easily researched online. The response, as I have last checked, has only one response which directed the user to a tutorial instead of answering all their questions. Overall, this may have helped the user by pointing them in the right direction, but it would have probably been faster if the poster conducted research beforehand, which is a key factor in asking a smart question.
